# optical

A GPL Optical simulation program for mixed coherent / incoherent multilayer systems

Features and capabilities:

Can treat multilayers with any number of coherent and incoherent layer in any position and for any Incidence angle using a Generalized Scattering Matrix Method

Can compute total light Reflectance, Transmittance, internal Absorption and internal Energy Flux

Can do thickness determination by fitting of experimental R and T spectra

EMA (Effective Medium Approximation) for mixed phase materials is integrated in the structure editor

Is a Python cross-platform software released under the GPL license
